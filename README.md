# frontend-config

These are a few of the packages and configurations that I use when developing frontend and JavaScript/Typescript projects. I wouldn't really recommend anyone other than me using them.

## Packages

### `eslint`

This is my TypeScript ESLint configuration, with an optional configuration for React.

### `stylelint`

My configuration for StyleLint.

### `tsconfig`

The settings I use on the compiler for TypeScript.
