# frontend-config

These are a few of the packages and configurations that I use when developing
frontend and JavaScript/Typescript projects. I wouldn't really recommend
anyone other than me using them.

## Packages

- `eslint-javascript`
- `eslint-react`
- `eslint-typescript`
- `stylelint`
- `tsconfig`
